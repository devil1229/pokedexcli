# pokedexcli

We're going to build a Pokedex in a command-line REPL. We'll use the Pok√©API to power all of the data we'll need. If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

Learned many things in Go - 

1. Building a cli application in go
2. How to parse JSON in Go
3. Practice making HTTP requests in Go
4. How to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
5. Get hands-on practice with local Go development and tooling
6. bout caching and how to use it to improve performance
